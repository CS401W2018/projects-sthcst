                <p>Our story began with a visionâ€”a young graduate from the Philippines, armed with determination, fresh ideas, and a degree in Civil Engineering, set out to redefine construction in the country. In 1997, Don established Rising Eagle Construction with the goal of providing quality, affordable, and reliable construction services to Filipinos.
                </p>
                <p>
                From its humble beginnings as a one-person operation handling small residential projects, the firm steadily gained a reputation for excellence, integrity, and dedication. Fueled by a deep commitment to helping families and businesses turn their dreams into reality, the company expanded its expertise to larger-scale projects, including commercial buildings, infrastructure, and industrial facilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                We are proud to be a 100% Filipino-owned company that continues to grow while staying true to our roots.
