        <h2>Who is Porter Robinson?</h2>
        <p class="main_p">Porter Robinson is a very famous EDM Artist. Given the fact that most 
            of his fans are in the young age, some are also kids who are depressed 
            and mostly detained in their houses. It is very interesting how Porter 
            catches the hearts and interests of his fans.</p>
        <p class="main_p"> Porter Robinson is an American DJ and EDM Producer. He became famous 
            because of his song "Say My Name", which reached number one on a very 
            famous media streaming platform in the US.</p>

                <h3>Shelter</h3>
                <p>"Shelter" is my favorite song, and is probably my most favorite 
                    of all time. I am pretty sure that I am not the only one who 
                    thinks this way. When this was first released in 2016, it was 
                    like a bomb. Different people from all over the world were 
                    very excited because of the mixture of two of the greatest 
                    EDM musicians ever!</p>

                <h3>Everything Goes On</h3>
                <p>This song is another favorite of mine. There were a lot of 
                    things that made this very good. One is the lyrics. Porter is 
                    known as someone who thinks of songs that are very hard to 
                    understand. In fact, there were even different groups all over 
                    the world who would gather just to talk about their own 
                    interpretations of his songs. This song in particular is very 
                    interesting because it also is a song from a video game.</p>

                <h3>Sad Machine</h3>
                <p>A fan of Porter made up a story about this song where an AI 
                    survived an apocalypse that ended the human race on Earth. 
                    There were different parts of the lyrics where the AI would 
                    feel very sad and lonely, making the music more relatable to 
                    most of his fans.</p>
