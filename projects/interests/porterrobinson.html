        <p>Porter Robinson is a very famous EDM Artist. Given the fact that most of his 
            fans are in the young age, some are also kids who are depressed and mostly
            detained in their houses. It is very interesting how Porter catches the hearts
            and interests of his fans. 
        </p>
        <p>Porter Robinson is an American DJ and EDM Producer. He became famous because of
            his song Say My Name, which reached number one in a very famous media
            streaming platform in the US.

            <li><h3>Shelter</h3></li>
            <p>Shelter is my favorite song, and is probably my most favorite of all time.
                I am pretty sure that I am not the only one who thinks this way. When this
                was first released in 2016, it was like a bomb. Different people from all 
                over the world were very excited because of the mixture of two of the
                greatest EDM musicians ever! 
            </p>
            <li><h3>Everything Goes On</h3></li>
            <p>This song is another favorite of mine. There were a lot of things that made
                this very good. One is the lyrics. Porter is known as someone who thinks
                of songs that are very hard to understand. In fact, there were even
                different groups all over the world who would gather just to talk about
                their own interpretations of his songs. This song in particular is very
                interesting because it also is a song from a video game.
            </p>
            <li><h3>Sad Machine</h3></li>
            <p>A fan of Porter made up a story about this song that an AI made it through
                an apocalypse that ended the human race here on earth. There were
                different parts of the lyrics where the AI would feel very sad and lonely
                that would make the music more relatable to most of his fans.
