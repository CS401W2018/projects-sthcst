        <h1>My Interest - EDMs</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <h2>What are EDMs?</h2>
        <p>This is a genre of music that is mainly focused on music that is mostly created electronically. 
            Unlike other genres where an instrument is usually used to create music, EDMs are mostly made 
            in computers. The earliest EDMs are made by KraftWerk, the first EDM group to popularize this 
            genre. They used synthesizers, drum machines, and vocoders. According to the website 
            <a href="https://themusicessentials.com/editorials/when-was-edm-invented/">themusicessentials.com</a>, 
            they were the ones to influence many genres such as techno, electro, hip-hop, and many more.
        </p>
        <h2>Why EDMs?</h2>
        <p>EDMs are catching a lot of interests that the younger generation really loves. In fact, other 
            people think that this is connected to the fact that the younger generation really loves to 
            mess around, or even in using technology in general. EDMs are also very easy to make lately. 
            Different apps are available to be used by anyone, even though they do not know how to make 
            music in the first place. Second, there are different online tutorials that can help people, 
            young or old, to make them.</p>
        <h2>My Favorite EDM Artists</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Porter Robinson</h3>
                <p>This guy has been my favorite of all the artists when I heard his song with Madeon 
                    called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzQ6gRAEoy0">Shelter</a>. This song 
                    was very special to me since I first heard this. I would be telling more about this 
                    song in the next page.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Gryffin</h3>
                <p>Unlike most EDM musicians, this guy (along with Porter Robinson) are some of the few 
                    who still make not-so-irritating/noisy music. This guy has been in my top 3 ever 
                    since I heard his song "All You Need to Know". This song was very important to me 
                    because back when I was in a very depressing situation, I was praying so hard for 
                    comfort and help. Then as I was driving home, I suddenly heard this song. Its lyrics 
                    say, "You will never be alone, and that's all you need to know".</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Hoang</h3>
                <p>This guy only has a few songs that I like, but that makes him one of my favorites. 
                    His songs, although not all, are better than most EDMs combined. I love his song, 
                    "Run Back to You". It was around 2020 when I heard this song. I was on the road 
                    driving a 7-hour trip from Manila to my place, and it was very boring. I felt like 
                    I had already played all of my songs in my playlists. Then, I decided to play a 
                    random song, and this was it. It felt like something struck me, and I played this 
                    song the whole time I was driving home.</p>
