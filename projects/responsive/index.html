                        <p>This is my mom. She loves to take care of all of us. She is the bravest woman I know. She loves to cook, clean, and teach us how to do certain things like speaking in English, singing, and how to become nice to other people.</p>

                        <p>This is me. I am the eldest of four siblings. I love to eat Spaghetti (which is something I can eat all day). I also love to sing, drive everywhere, and watch movies. I am the kind of person who loves to do anything on my computer. I also fancy choir singing, and anything related to cars.</p>

                        <p>This my younger sister, Dana. She is also here in BYUH with me. She loves to sing. She is even better in singing than me. I love it when we talk about serious stuff because I know that she would always have my back.</p>

                    <p>This is Andrei. He is currently serving in the Philippines Manila Mission as a full-time missionary. He is not someone you would like to be in trouble with because he will eat you alive. He is very brave, and is very industrious. He will clean all day if he wants to.</p>

                        <p>This is my youngest sister, Eyya. She is still young, but is full of energy. She loves to take after Dana, which means she also loves to sing. She could literally sing anywhere. She loves to talk to other people, even strangers. She is not afraid of anyone.</p>
