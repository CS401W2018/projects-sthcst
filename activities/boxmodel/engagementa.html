                <h3>What is the difference between block tags and inline tags?</h3>
                <p>
                    The difference between block tags and inline tags are depending on which lines their elements start at. For block tags, they always start from a new line. For inline tags, they always never start in a new line.

                <h3>What is the margin, border, and padding?</h3>
                <p>
                    In HTML, margins give extra space between the element and the edge of the page, like when you leave some room around a picture. Borders are like the outline around an element. They can be close to the element or farther away if you add padding. Padding is the space inside the border, like a cushion around the element to give it some breathing room.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    What are units of measurement you can use in CSS?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    There are lots of units of measurement that can be used in CSS, such as px, in, cm, mm, pt, pc, %, em, rem, vw, and many more. These are used to make sure that the kinds of measurements that you put in will be according to what is wanted and needed for the viewer to see.

                <h3>
                    When would you use a figure tag?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    When using figure tags, these should be used with images with captions, videos, illustrations, tables, and basically anything that has media embedded in it.
