        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>What kind of photos are good to encode using JPEG?
                <p>Photos that are good to encode using JPEG are images that have a variety of colors, and photos that are used for sharing online.</p>
            </li>
            <li>What kind of photos are good to encode using GIF?
                <p>These are the kinds of photos that have simple graphics, animations, web elements, and images with limited colors.</p>
            </li>
            <li>What is unique about the PNG format?
                <p>This type of file uses lossless compression, which means that no image data is lost during compression. This can show clearer photos on websites, and anywhere that there is a media reader software.</p>
            </li>
            <li>How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?
                <p>There are different kinds of ways to do this, but the easiest way to do so is by using width and height; manipulating both.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of resizing it using CSS?
                <p>Resizing photos with editing software keeps the image quality high and reduces the file size, which helps the website load faster.</p>
