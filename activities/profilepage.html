    <h1>Seth Acosta</h1>
    <p>I was born in the Philippines. There are different things about me that are very interesting. First, there are different things that I like, such as Spaghetti (which is weird for me because I am asian), listening to music, watching movies (anime, drama, comedies), and editing videos. I also love to learn new things, such as different cars, computers, and more things pertaining to technologies.</p>
    <p>I am currently working on my Programming Skills, along with my singing and Excel Skills (which might have already given you an idea on what my major and minors are, respectively). Anyway, I am currently a Sophomore here in Brigham Young University-Hawaii. I just got married last December, and am going to our first yeat together with my wife.</p>
    <p>These are my hobbies:</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>Fixing software bugs and errors</li>
        <li>Singing while taking a shower</li>
        <li>Annoying my very cute wife</li>
        <li>Driving without knowing where to go</li>
    </ol>
