    <h1>Seth Acosta</h1>
    <p>I was born in the Philippines. There are different things about me that are very interesting. First, there are different things that I like, such as <tt>Spaghetti</tt> (which is weird for me because I am asian), listening to music, watching movies (anime, drama, comedies), and editing videos. I also love to learn new things, such as different cars, computers, and more things pertaining to technologies. My semi-favorite chocolate is M	&#38; M.</p>
    <p>I am currently working on my <b>Programming Skills</b>, along with my <b>singing</b> and <b>Excel Skills</b> (which might have already given you an idea on what my major and minors are, respectively). Anyway, I am currently a Sophomore here in <em>Brigham Young University-Hawaii</em>. I just got married last December, and am going to our first yeat together with my wife.</p>
    <p>This is my wishlist for Christmas (putting up the price in here just in case anyone wants to buy me something):</p>
