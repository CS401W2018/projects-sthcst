        <p class="sitedesc">Here are the details of my Final Project</p>
        <h3 class="question">The Title and Topic of your Site</h3>
        <p>Rising Eagle Construction</p>
        <h3 class="question">A brief paragraph why you chose this topic</h3>
        <p>I chose this topic because I kept on promising my Dad that I was going to make a website to promote his construction firm, and it was being pushed over for a lot of times. Thus, doing this can help him find more clients, and even help him gather more information, while also sharing his information to a lot of people.</p>
        <h3 class="question">List out the content you will have on the homepage and each of the five pages.</h3>
        <p>Homepage: A brief introduction of the company, a slideshow of the projects that they have done, and a contact form.</p>
        <p>About Us: A brief history of the company, the services that they offer, and the team behind the company.</p>
        <p>Services: A list of the services that they offer, and a brief description of each service.</p>
        <p>Projects: A gallery of the projects that they have done, and a brief description of each project.</p>
        <p>Contact: A contact form, and a map of the location of the company.</p>
        <h3 class="question">What fields (or information you will collect) will ypu put into your form? What data will go on your table?</h3>
        <p>Fields: Name, Email, Phone Number, Message</p>
        <p>Data: Past Projects locations, time it took to build the structure, and their building types (one for each type).</p>
        <h3 class="question">How will you collect information/images/content for your site? You need at least 5 references on your site, list our at least 2 of references you plan on using.</h3>
        <p>I will collect information from my Dad, and I will also take pictures of the projects that they have done. I will also ask for the permission of the clients if I can use their projects as a reference.</p>
