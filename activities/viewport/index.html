            <h3>Why do we need a viewport tag?</h3>
            <p>Without a viewport tag, mobile browsers will render the page at a typical desktop screen width, and then scale the page down to fit the device's screen. This can make the page difficult to read and use on a small screen.</p>
            <h3>When you select the same tag twice, and in one of them you say "flex-direction: column;" and the other says "flex-direction: row;", which one takes priority?</h3>
            <p>The last one takes priority.</p>
            <h3>How do you change the CSS for a web page displayed on a phone?</h3>
            <p>Use media queries to change the CSS for a web page displayed on a phone.</p>
