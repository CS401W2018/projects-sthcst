        <h2>What is the difference between a block and an inline tag? Give examples of each one.</h2>
        <p>
            Block tags are tags that take up the full width of the page. They are used to create large sections of content. Examples of block tags are <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>. Inline tags are tags that only take up the width of the content inside of them. They are used to create small sections of content. Examples of inline tags are <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>.

        <h2>What is normal flow in HTML?</h2>
        <p>
            Normal flow is the default way that elements are displayed on a page. Elements are displayed one after the other in the order that they appear in the HTML document. Elements are displayed from top to bottom and left to right.
        </p>
        <h2>What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</h2>
        <p>
            Float is a CSS property that allows an element to be pushed to the left or right of its container. When an element is floated, it is taken out of the normal flow of the document and other elements will flow around it. You need to clear the float because if you don't, the floated element will affect the layout of other elements on the page. Clearing the float ensures that the element is contained within its parent element and does not affect the layout of other elements.
        </p>
        <h2>What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</h2>
        <p>
            Absolute positioning positions an element relative to its closest positioned ancestor. If there is no positioned ancestor, the element is positioned relative to the initial containing block. Fixed positioning positions an element relative to the viewport, which means that the element will stay in the same position on the screen even when the user scrolls. Relative positioning positions an element relative to its normal position in the document flow. The element will still take up space in the document flow, but it can be moved from its normal position using the top, right, bottom, and left properties.

        <h2>How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</h2>
        <p>
            To make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices, you can use CSS to style the buttons and make them responsive. You can use media queries to change the styling of the buttons based on the screen size. You can also use flexbox or grid to create a responsive layout for the buttons. You can use hover effects to make the buttons more interactive and user-friendly.
