            <li><h4>What is the best way to make sure that you get a good grade?</h4></li>
                <p>The best way to make sure that I get a good grade is to make sure that I understand everything in this class, including the different activities that are supposed to be finished in class. I should also be attentive, and not be afraid of asking for help.</p>
            <li><h4>When is your project due?</h4></l1>
                <p>This upcoming projevy of mine is due on Monday.</p>
            <li><h4>What are special entity characters?</h4></l1>
                <p>These are symbols that the computer treats in a special way, so you can't just use them like regular letters or numbers in your code</p>
            <li><h4>What is the difference between OL and UL Tags?</h4></l1>
                <p>The difference between these two TAGS is tghe way they are presented.  They are both tags, but OL means ordered lists, meaning that they are visually in order with numbers and letters that come in order.</p>
                <p>Unordered lists on the other hand are just like bullet points, and it doesn't matter which point on the list comes first.</p>
