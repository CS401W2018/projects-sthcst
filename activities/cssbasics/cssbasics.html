        <h2>Explain the difference between inline, embedded, and external CSS</h2>
        <p>The difference between these two is where we put in the "style" of the whole HTML file.</p>
        <p><strong>Inline CSS</strong> is like hardcoding each tags with their corresponding "style". This gives a long time for the people who design to actually design the whole HTML.</p>
        <p><strong>Embedded CSS</strong> is if the "style" command is in the head, which adds more space in the HTML file. This is hard for the people who would want to just focus on the HTML, and the flexibility of having just one CSS file for a whole group of pages. </p>
        <p><strong>External CSS</strong> is definitely the best option when choosing from the three. This is very easy to use since multiple HTML files can root their designs from just one CSS file. This can help with the continuity of the design,and to not make everything confusing.</p>
        <h2>Explain why you should only use external CSS.</h2>
        <p>One should only use external CSS because this is the only way that there is going to be continuity, and that this is the main point of making code more efficient. This can help with making backend codes be clean and more organized.</p>
        <h2>What is a selector used for?</h2>
        <p>A <strong>selector</strong> is used for selecting which tags were to be editted in the CSS. For example, if I were to edit a paragraph, I would write "p" as my selector. Or, if I were to edit my headers, I would write "h1" or "h2" as my selectors.</p>
