        <h3>List out the different ways to select an item.</h3>
        <ol class="mainp">
            <li>Tag Name</li>
            <li>ID - #</li>
            <li>Class</li>
            <li>Descendent</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>What is the difference between an ID and a Class?</h3>
        <p class="mainp">An ID is like a variable that you cannot reuse or assign to multiple tags. IDs are usually nouns. On the other hand, a class is an adjective and you can reuse it.</p>
        <h3>What  is the difference between a SPAN Tag and a DIV Tag?</h3>
        <p class="mainp">The difference is first, the DIV goes inside a box when tagged and takes up the whole line in the screen, and the SPAN just edits the text without changing the layout of the site.</p>
        <h3>What is the difference between a DIV tag and HEADER, MAIN, FOOTER?</h3>
        <p class="mainp">Header, Main, Footer are all under the DIV Tag. DIV tags are just a container; a generic one. While the Header, Main, and Footer are used to have a structure inside the whole code.</p>
        <h3>What are different ways to select a color?</h3>
        <p class="mainp">A color can be selected using the RGB Values.</p>
